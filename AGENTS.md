# AGENTS.md — sigma-migration-skills

Migration skills for moving BI tools (**Tableau, Power BI, Qlik, ThoughtSpot,
QuickSight, Looker, Cognos**) to
**Sigma**: per-tool *converters* (source → Sigma data model + workbook, with
warehouse parity verification) and read-only *assessments* (tenant inventory →
migration-readiness readout + shortlist).

This repo is packaged as a Claude Code plugin marketplace, but the skills are
agent-neutral: each is a `SKILL.md` (instructions) plus `scripts/` (Ruby/Python/
shell) and `refs/`. Any coding agent (Cursor, Cortex Code, etc.) can run them by
reading the relevant `SKILL.md` and executing its scripts.

## How to use a skill

1. Pick the skill from the index below that matches the user's intent.
2. **Read that skill's `SKILL.md` in full first** — it is the source of truth for
   the phased workflow. The `refs/*.md` next to it cover details.
3. Run its scripts **from the skill directory** (script paths are relative, e.g.
   `scripts/setup.rb`). `cd` into the skill dir, then invoke.

| Land a Tableau published-datasource/extract in Snowflake or Databricks | `tableau-vds-to-cdw` | `plugins/tableau-to-sigma/skills/tableau-vds-to-cdw/` |

Assessments are read-only (never write to the source or post to Sigma); run one
to pick what to convert, then hand off to the matching converter.

Each converter's phase numbering is local to its SKILL.md — the canonical
Assess → Discover → Reuse-check → Convert → Post-DM gate → Build workbook →
Layout → Parity → Security → Enhance arc, with the per-skill phase-number
mapping, is in [`docs/phase-schema.md`](docs/phase-schema.md). Never renumber
a skill's phases.

## Corpus (regression fixtures)

`corpus/` holds per-tool source artifacts + golden converter outputs + a
runner (`corpus/run-corpus.sh --check`, creds-free). When you change a
converter or builder, run the corpus check and reconvert the affected case
(`--reconvert` prints the exact tool call; `--diff` byte-compares after id
normalization). See `corpus/README.md` for the case inventory and how to add
cases.

## Credentials (agent-neutral)

All scripts read credentials from **environment variables**. Setup writes them to
two places so they work under any agent:

- `~/.claude/settings.json` — Claude Code auto-loads this into the env.
- `~/.sigma-migration/env` — a neutral, sourceable file (`export KEY='value'`,
  mode 0600) for every other agent and plain shells.

`get-token.sh`, `get-tableau-token.sh`, and the Ruby libs (`lib/sigma_rest.rb`,
`lib/tableau_rest.rb`) **auto-source `~/.sigma-migration/env`** when the vars
aren't already set — so non-Claude agents work with no manual sourcing. Existing
env always wins.

**Sigma** (all converters): `SIGMA_BASE_URL`, `SIGMA_CLIENT_ID`,
`SIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET`. Configure once with `ruby scripts/setup.rb` (in the
tableau-to-sigma skill), or `export` them yourself. Then mint a ~1h bearer token:

```bash
bash -c 'eval "$(scripts/get-token.sh)"; <your curl using $SIGMA_API_TOKEN>'
```

> Keep the `eval` and the command in the **same** `bash -c '...'` — `$()` creates
> a subshell where the exported token dies immediately.

**Tableau** (PAT mode, when the Tableau MCP isn't available): `TABLEAU_SERVER_URL`,
`TABLEAU_SITE_CONTENT_URL`, `TABLEAU_PAT_NAME`, `TABLEAU_PAT_SECRET`. Configure
with `ruby scripts/setup-tableau.rb`; sign in with
`eval "$(scripts/get-tableau-token.sh)"`. Other source tools (Power BI, Qlik,
ThoughtSpot) have their own auth — see each skill's `SKILL.md` / `QUICKSTART.md`.

## Optional MCP servers

The skills use the Sigma REST API directly (via the scripts above), so MCP is not
required. Where available, these enhance discovery/verification:

- **Sigma MCP** — query built workbooks to verify parity.
- **Tableau MCP** — view/datasource discovery without PAT setup.
- **sigma-data-model converter** (MCP) — used by the Power BI / Qlik converters
  for source-formula → Sigma-formula translation.

Configure them in your agent's MCP config; the skills fall back to REST/CLI when
they're absent.

## Conventions that bite non-Claude agents

- **Don't inline Ruby/Python inside `bash -c`** for anything over ~5 lines —
  nested-quote escaping silently breaks. Write a `.py`/`.rb` file and exec it.
- **Scripts are relative to the skill dir** — `cd` there first.
- **Tokens expire (~1h)** — re-mint on a 401; never cache across long runs except
  via the Ruby libs, which auto-refresh.
